          <li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
              <p><strong>Dragons &amp; Wagons</strong> is a <em>table-top role playing game</em> that is designed to bring roleplay back to the roleplaying genre of roleplaying games.</p>
          <li><strong>The World</strong></li>
              <p>Our World takes place in <em>The Nine Kingdoms</em> a collection of lands each seperated by ocean waters, each having only one true kingdom</p>

          <li><strong>The story</strong></li>
              <p>A roleplaying game with a weak story isnt really going to leave much of an impact on the players or the dungeon master that runs it. The purpose of a roleplaying game is <q>fun</q>, and if your players are bored and you are bored, then <q>fun</q> has clearly packed up and moved away. </p>
